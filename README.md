Beer Culture of the Northwest


Living in Tempe near Arizona State University we can assure the alcohol was not lacking, but there was a lack of fresh local brews leaving us with a thirst for good beer! 
Our first stop after getting settled into our tiny studio apartment and cheering the Sea Hawks into Super Bowl victory we stumbled upon Redhook Brewery. 
For $5 we got a tour of the brewery, a lesson on how beer is brewed, fun facts about Redhook's history, AND 5 beer samples- I was hooked! (pun not intended, but it works so I'm leaving it). 
So onward we went, on the hunt for local breweries with delicous beer and boy, we have found the meta of craft brewing here in the Seattle area. 

Beer is its own culture here in the Northwest and why not?! 
Washington produces around seventy-five percent of the hops in the US and with our buddies in Oregon producing around seventeen percent it's hard not to put these beautiful hops to work.
A vigorous hopped jolt has been embraced by the brewers of the Northwest creating  a new style of beer- the IPL or Indian Pale Lager. 
Being IPA lovers we were excited when Georgetown came out with Eddie, a Seattle brewed IPL, and boy it did not disappoint. 
Both Georgetown and Gigantic Brewing of Oregon have created the perfect beer: A dry hopped, oh so perfect bitters start with a lager smooth and refreshing finish. 
Lets just say I was beyond sad when Eddie went off tap at Redhook this past week! 
Another style of beer that seems to be a staple of Northwest breweries is the session ale. A session ale was created on the idea that people should be able enjoy multiple pints without being overtly intoxiacted- a fabulous idea for say a Sea Hawks game. 
We've seen primarily session IPAs or pale ales- all highly drinkable with the biter of hops but only reaching 5% ABV. 
Hoorah for the day drinker!


Here is our unfinished and ongoing local brewery BEER COMPENDIUM: 
We are starting with the breweries close to home, but will be adding in Seattle brews soon enough!

Redhook: Woodinville, WA

This is our home base, and yes, we did become Mug Clubers December 1st! 
Since they are a part of the Craft Brew Alliance they always have a good selection of Kona and Widmer Brothers in addition to their staple beers. 

Big Ballard IPA  8.8% ABV 73 IBU For those who love IPAs this is for you. 
This hop forward beer gets your taste buds buzzing with its bitter front and crisp finish.

Wisecracker Wit 5.3% ABV 8 IBU A summer season that is one of Katieâ€™s favorites. 
It is a full bodied Belgian style with fresh ginger and orange brewed in. No need to add anything to this Belgian pale (suck it Blue Moon)!

ESB 5.8% ABV 28 IBU A Redhook benchmark beer, this has a nice malted sweetness to it with a citrus hopped undertone.
A well balanced beer that goes with any occasion. 

ECS Blonde 5.2% ABV 25 IBU Crisp and refreshing light beer that has replaced Budweiser and even Corona in our household. 
It also happens to be the main beer of the Seattle Sounders, so drink up!

Blackhook Porter 5.2% ABV 
Although neither of us are really into porter style beers, this porter has a creamy texture to it that adds to the chilled coffee taste.
